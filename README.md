# steam-community-market-history-inspector
## Allows you to inspect in game a CS2 item that you sold on the Steam community market — in my market history.

Surely, you've had situations where you sold a skin a long time ago, and now you want to check what float value, pattern, and stickers it had at that time. However, you can't inspect the skin right away — it takes a little bit more steps. 
That's a JS code that allows you to inspect an item in the game, because they're hidden by default. 
Sure, you can find that links in devtools by self, but this approach lets you get multiple links faster.  

Also I'll later pack that in extension for Chromium-based browsers.
